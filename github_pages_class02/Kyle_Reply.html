1. Lialina's opinion is that the word 'user' is necessary in understanding the relationship between people and the technology they use. She goes on to explain that the current narrative of the word 'user' being problematic in current Interactive Design discourse is problematic in itself—the idea that the word 'people' is more appropriate is an issue as it eliminates distinction between a developer and the person interacting with the technology.

2. Lialina's ideal internet user is what she refers to as a General Purpose User, which simply put is anyone who uses technology as an augmentation of their behaviour, not as a catalyst. To create 3D models in Excel, build a calculator in Minecraft, or decide which browser tool to install or not install is to exercise one's autonomy. The ability to break intention and conform it to one's needs or wants is, to Lialina, the epitome of what it means to be a 'user'.

3. I think that the desktop customization tool Rainmeter (Links to an external site.) is a great example of a 'gap-friendly' interface. It allows one to design their own desktop icons for anything, whether it's programs they have on their computer or webpages they like to visit. You can design your own clock, weather, audio visualizer interfaces, etc., meaning that the user retains full agency to individualize their computer, instead of the typical changing of a background image.
