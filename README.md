////////////////////////////////// 

in scrape-test/scripts, there are two unsused .js files - scrape-reddit.js and bundle.js. These were meant to be used as a way to dynamically update the website with scraped data from reddit using a puppeteer ver. of the site; however, it is proving to be too difficult to do so as cheerio and puppeteer are run through my client and not in the browser.
