			“The open nature of the Web as medium (Web pages are computer files which can always be edited) means . . . the result is a collection, not a story. Indeed, how can one keep a coherent narrative or any other development trajectory through the material if it keeps changing?”&nbsp</br>
			 — Lev Manovich, Database as Symbolic Form
			</br>
			</br>

			 While this passage is removed from the context of its whole, I felt compelled to respond to this point of Manovich’s. Maybe development trajectory is unnecessary. Perhaps we ought to think of the intangible nature of the web as more like oral tradition, stories that change based on the relationship between storyteller and listener. Maybe websites are never truly complete because of this reason. The flexibility of the web allows for variations of the medium, retellings of stories with the website-creator imparting a piece of themselves into it. One may tell the story through text and layout, another might tell it through interaction and audio. Temporal solidification is irrelevant in this context as the story will be shaped by the conditional experiences of its teller, the website by its designer; a Baudrillardian reclamation of the real through symbolic exchange via the web. 
			 </br>

			 Maybe what's important isn't the words we choose to tell the story, but rather the way in which we tell them. Screw the trajectory.
