		<h2>"What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?
		</br>
		</br> 
		What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.
		</br>
		</br>
		From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?"</h2>
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		1. Lialina's opinion is that the word 'user' is necessary in understanding the relationship between people and the technology they use. She goes on to explain that the current narrative of the word 'user' being problematic in current Interactive Design discourse is problematic in itself—the idea that the word 'people' is more appropriate is an issue as it eliminates distinction between a developer and the person interacting with the technology.
		</br>
		</br>
		2. Lialina's ideal internet user is what she refers to as a General Purpose User, which simply put is anyone who uses technology as an augmentation of their behaviour, not as a catalyst. To create 3D models in Excel, build a calculator in Minecraft, or decide which browser tool to install or not install is to exercise one's autonomy. The ability to break intention and conform it to one's needs or wants is, to Lialina, the epitome of what it means to be a 'user'.  
		</br>
		</br>
		3. I think that the desktop customization tool Rainmeter (Links to an external site.) is a great example of a 'gap-friendly' interface. It allows one to design their own desktop icons for anything, whether it's programs they have on their computer or webpages they like to visit. You can design your own clock, weather, audio visualizer interfaces, etc., meaning that the user retains full agency to individualize their computer, instead of the typical changing of a background image.

		<h1>The Poetry of Tools</h1>
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		<h2>"In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?
		</br> 
		</br>
		Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why."</h2>
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		1. I suppose in a basic sense she is asking us to try to separate the tool and our usage of it, so that we might be able to use the tool in a way other than it was intended. Her statement that technology is a form of language I think sets up her position around poetry. If we understand poetry to be something that uses the qualities of a language to create alternative meanings, then we can understand how Seu wants us to use this action of defamiliarization to understand the poetic capabilities of digital technology.
		</br>
		</br>
		2. Slow growth and Slow death:

		Seu is describing the web as a living thing—able to grow, able to die, and is time-sensitive. Though while she states "the web is living because it can die", I think it is more likely it is living because we are living. The web is an extension of humanity and our experience of temporal phenomena, not a thing on its own.
		</br>
		</br>
		3. Related piece—the internet archive / any web-preserving website or interface. I think it fits well with this definition, as I think what Seu is describing, at least with her reference to Penelope Umbrico’s All the Catalogs (A-Z), is a very human aspect of the internet—preservation. Dead links and link rot are sort of analogous to our own understanding of death—we have all of these references to things, like people—but aside from snapshots, summaries, descriptions, etc, the source material is gone.

		<h1>My Website is a Shifting House</h1>
		</br>
		<h2>"Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.
		</br>
		</br>
		In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. 
		</br>
		</br>
		Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here."</h2>
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		1. Schwulst advocates for individual websites because she argues that the web, from its conception, is a network of individual nodes that becomes a living entity through its interconnection of all nodes. Currently there is an illusion of individualism and self-expression through social media platforms, which in reality obfuscates, commercializes, curates, and dictates our ability to be truly expressive. 'Expression' in this nodal cluster often looks the same, a hyper-realism that echoes something familiar but never really engages with anything other than imitation. It's the life-like pencil drawing of a lion that we know we have seen somewhere yet cannot attribute to a specific artist. But for Schwulst, and I suppose myself the more I engage with this, the web ought not be contained in that single memetic cluster, instead being free to prototype beyond the constraints of pure market utility.

		<h2>"To begin to get you comfortable with the use of code to create form, we will start with a drawing exercise. Create a typeface with only HTML and CSS. It should be a minimum of 26 characters. All characters should live on a single HTML page.
		</br>
		</br>
		So we can re-deploy these forms in future work, ensure that all the DIVs you create use position:absolute within an assigned character div.
		</br>

		A typeface is a consistent formal system so think about things like scale, proportion, stroke, serif, angle, contrast, etc.</h2>

		<h2>For the next assignment for this course you will research and iterate around a key interactive element relating to the desktop browser experience. You will create an abstract website that—not only deploys your assigned interactive element—but finds its ontological center in the element itself.

		Through the assignment, you’ll explore the possibilities and limitations of the web as a medium, engage ‘code logic’ as a mode of design thinking, and practice being resourceful and ‘learning on demand.’</h2>
