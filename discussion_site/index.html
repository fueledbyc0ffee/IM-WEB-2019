			We often think of the website itself as the container for information rather than the medium of self expression — the gallery so to speak. Rather, I like to think that each site has the capability to be its own artwork, reflective of something unhinged from the restrictions of market-dictation.

			Websites are paintings, illustrations, installations, photographs, films, etc., and we all display them in a global gallery called the internet. People view them in different ways — some may examine and engage with the content, while others may try to pick apart the technical aspects. Some may not even be interested at all. And like all pieces in a gallery, no piece stays forever. At some point one artwork will be replaced with another, and the cycle will continue.
